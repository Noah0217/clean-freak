const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const { Schema } = mongoose;

const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
const Category = require('./Category');




 //AFTER Choosing category they are able to choose the  "product" house keeper etc im wondering if i can change that or would it mess up my terminal like how seeds.js has to be named that due to npm run seeds right? idk
